# Extract Lexile Score of Book from an Amazon Link

This code will take a list of books in the form of an amazon url and extract the lexile
score of the book if available.

Amazon does not always have a lexile score of a book. As such those are ignored.

There are still issues to work out, this was a quick and dirty solution to get us going.

The main purpose was to use the Rory List of books from *The Gilmore Girls* and introduce them to our kids in order of lexile score.

Lists of the Rory books are widely available, but not with Lexile score and not sorted in such a way.

So I devised this code to get us the scores from a google sheet that had the list with links
to amazon.
